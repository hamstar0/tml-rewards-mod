This mod rewards players for game progression with Progress Points; a spendable, non-transferable currency to purchase rare, hard-to-grind items to speed up the game. Consult the Wayfarer town npc for spending options (note that more purchases are unlocked as you progress the game).

Settings and shop loadouts can be adjusted with the mod's configs.
