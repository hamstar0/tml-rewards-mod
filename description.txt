This mod rewards players for game progression with Progress Points; a spendable, non-transferable currency to purchase rare, hard-to-grind items to speed up the game. Consult the Wayfarer town npc for spending options (note that more purchases are unlocked as you progress the game).

Use the provided in-game chat commands (type /help to list, scroll with arrow keys to find) or the Mod Helpers control panel to adjust settings and shop loadout.
